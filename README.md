> A Docker image for [Paperkey] â€” an OpenPGP key archiver

[Paperkey] by David Shaw is a tool that lets you backup OpenPGP keys by printing them on paper. It compresses the key by removing all the unnecessary information and formats it in a way that allows easier re-entering in case a recover is needed.

## Usage

```sh
# pull the image
docker pull nickkaramoff/paperkey

# run the container with volume binding to the current directory
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/ nickkaramoff/paperkey --secret-key my-secret-key.gpg --output to-print.txt
```
